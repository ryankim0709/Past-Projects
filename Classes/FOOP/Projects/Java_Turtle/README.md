# Turtle art in java

## Project 1: Drawing simple shapes => ```BasicShapes.java```
In this project, I am creating a polygon, pinwheel, and asterisk based on the number of sides a user wants. Additionally, the user can type on colors and the program will automatically rotate between the colors

## Project 2: Drawing a snowflake => ```SnowFlake.java```
In this project, I created a snowflake with ```n``` where ```n``` is the number of sides the user inputed. Similiar to project one, users can enter in RGB colors and the code will cycle through the colors.

**IMPORTANT**: This project works best if the number of sides is greater than 2.
